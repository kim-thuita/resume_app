The app is called the resume_app, it brielfly discusses my experience in tech, the type of language i have specialized in and my social links.
I used the dart language and flutter to create the app, it basically shows my specialization and my profile social links.
The design i used is a sliding sheet, i used it to show addditional information such as my specialization.
The libraries i used are namely the sliding sheet, the fonts awesome icons, url launcher and animated text icons.I used the fonts awsome icon to display icons of socials such as the twitter one.I used the animated texts so as to animate my texts and also the url launcher so as to publish my social links in my icon buttons.
If i had more time i would add more links such as my gmail, my number and a lot more on my details.

One of the major challenges i faced is creating links and using the library launchurl to get my icon buttons to work, after googling what is required i made some adjustments to my manifest and now it finally got to work.
